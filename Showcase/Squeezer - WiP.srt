00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,794
In this video we introduce our Work-in-Progress paper about Squeezer, 

2
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:07,449
a tool for designing juicy effects in game prototypes.

3
00:00:08,427 --> 00:00:11,045
An example of adding juice to a game,

4
00:00:11,321 --> 00:00:15,122
could be taking a simple breakout clone like this one,

5
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:17,451
and turning it into this:

6
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:21,351
The goal of juice is to make actions feel significant. 

7
00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:25,617
Juice is usually applied to provide feedback to the player 

8
00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:28,952
for any input and object interaction they perform,

9
00:00:29,216 --> 00:00:33,379
as well as signalling when objects are created, destroyed or collected.

10
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,880
Designing juicy effects usually demands expertise within many subsystems, 

11
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:43,395
and easily means working with several different subsystems at once.

12
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:49,017
Even using state of the art systems, it can be hard to know how to get going.

13
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:53,479
Squeezer is our attempt at simplifying that process,

14
00:00:53,728 --> 00:00:58,693
by making it easy to add and design effect sequences for game prototypes.

15
00:00:58,864 --> 00:01:02,876
Squeezer can also help designers by generating effect sequences for them, 

16
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,885
based on a selected category and intensity. 

17
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:10,421
Even allowing the designer to lock certain parts of the effect sequence, 

18
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,197
while mutating or regenerating the rest.

19
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:16,679
The Squeezer workflow is slit into three steps, 

20
00:01:16,948 --> 00:01:19,666
(1) Setup Triggers, 

21
00:01:20,307 --> 00:01:26,716
(2) Generate or manually add sequences of effects to those triggers, 

22
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,987
(3) Tweak or Mutate effects until they suit the game.

23
00:01:32,738 --> 00:01:37,754
In the near future we will be expanding upon the generated effect sequences.

24
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:43,109
Use interactive evolution to help designers explore the possibility space 

25
00:01:43,096 --> 00:01:44,708
of effects within a game.

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:51,207
And looking at integrating the system within an automated game design process.

27
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:58,177
